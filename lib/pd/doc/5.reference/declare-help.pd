#X text 121 14 - set environment for loading patch;
#X text 45 43 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("extensions")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:;
#X text 41 179 -lib;
#X text 41 196 -stdlib;
#X text 41 143 -path;
#X text 41 160 -stdpath;
#X text 139 161 add to search path \, relative to Pd;
#X text 43 554 BUG: The name "-stdpath" is confusing \, as it has a
quite different effect from "-stdpath" on the pd command line.;
#X text 41 398 WARNING: as of version 0.47 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-stdpath" inside abstractions take effect only within those abstractions.
If Pd's compatibility version is set to 0.46 or earlier the old (buggy)
behavior takes effect.;
#X text 328 605 updated for Pd version 0.49;
#X text 139 143 add to search path \, relative to the patch or user
paths;
#X text 139 179 load a library \, relative to the patch or user paths
;
#X text 41 234 (For any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).
;
#X text 42 471 As of version 0.49 \, "declare -path" and "declare -lib"
will fall back to user search paths if the relative path to the patch
does not exit. To avoid checking further \, use an explicit relative
path by prepending "./" or "../" to the path or lib name.;
#X text 139 196 load a library \, relative to Pd;
#X text 41 296 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
"declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is loaded.
Or \, if you have files installed in the directory extra/stillmore
(in the Pd installation) you can get it using "declare -stdpath stillmore".
