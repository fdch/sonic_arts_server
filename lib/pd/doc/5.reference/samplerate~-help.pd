current audio sample rate. If called within a subwindow that is up-
or down-sampled \, the sample rate of signals within that subwindow
are reported.;
#X text 50 149 In this example we use the "pd-dsp-started" message
(automatically sent when DSP is started in Pd) to receive an update
whenever sample rate may have changed. This is useful when designing
filters whose coefficients usually have to be updated when the sample
rate changes.;
