#X text 148 26 - save and restore run-time state from within an abstraction
, f 70;
#X text 81 250 The savestate object is used inside abstractions to
save their state as they are used in a calling (parent) patch. When
the parent patch (such as this one \, which calls the "savestate-example"
abstraction) is saved \, the included savestate object sends a 'bang'
message out its right outlet \, with which the abstraction may respond
by presenting one or more 'list' messages back to the 'savestate' object.
These lists are saved as part of the calling patch. If the calling
patch is reopened later \, the lists are sent out the left outlet of
the savestate object. The abstraction can then use them to restore
its state.;
