#X text 132 24 - mal-designed snapshot~ extension - best not to use
this;
#X text 60 68 This is an attempt at making a version of snapshot~ that
trades off delay for time jitter control. Unfortunately it isn't fully
correct and will be replaced by a more correct one in the future. Since
this change will probably be incompatible with this object \, it is
probably best to avoid using it until it is working correctly.;
