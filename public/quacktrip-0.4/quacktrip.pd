#X text 440 8 This is a Pure Data patch allowing musicians (or others)
to make point-to-point \, uncompressed \, low-latency audio connections
\, through home routers \, between their computers. It's best if you
can run an ethernet cable from your computer to your router \, but
this will work over "wifi" (wireless networks) too.;
#X text 440 103 To make a call \, enter a unique "call name" (click
on the text area that says "this-call-name" and type in a new name)
\, then click "ON/OFF so that an "X" appears. When someone else makes
a call with the same name \, quacktrip should connect you together
in a call. A public "conniption" server (by default foo.ucsd.edu) helps
make the connection but the audio runs straight between the two computers.
;
#X text 439 383 You can also change the number of channels and/or the
block size of the audio you send to the other site. Click "2X" to send
each outgoing packet twice (this doubles the data rate but might give
fewer dropped packets).;
#X text 439 316 The FIFO size can be set to absorb network time variations
(in units of 64 samples). The "fill" counter shows how far ahead of
the incoming stream we are. If this number drops below 2 there will
be a dropout in the audio output.;
#X text 440 219 If the "calling" button is flashing we're either waiting
for a response from the server \, or from the peer. Once both of these
arrive the "connected" toggle turns on (gets an "x" mark.) At this
point a call is in progress and the "packets in" counter should be
changing. Press the "reset" button to set packet and drop counts back
to zero.;

#X text 63 15 MORE DETAILS;
#X text 20 36 Quacktrip is best suited for small (2 or 3 people) rehearsals
in which connections can run point-to-point. This gives the lowest
latency (delay) you can get \, but gets messy when more than three
people are involved. Also \, to reduce latency \, late or missing audio
is simply replaced with silence---so this solution is probably not
suitable for performances.;
#X text 25 635 This is open-source software with a BSD license.;
#X text 21 283 Anyway \, if you're using quacktrip \, the simplest
setup is to download the app (available either for Mac or PC \, assuming
I can get them both working). But in fact the "app" is really just
a copy of Pure Data configured to load this patch automatically. You
can also just download the patch and run it (along with whatever else
you want) from Pd itself. You can then modify things to \, for instance
\, place calls to more than one remote computer (just duplicate the
objects) \, or script the quack-panel object (as in the message box
below - the name "quack-panel-1" addresses the "quack-panel 1" object
in this patch). You might also want to assign input and output channels
differently by replacing the in-panel and out-panel objects. While
you're at it \, consider learning more about Pd - you can do a lot
with it :);
#X text 518 23 NETWORK HACKERY:;
#X text 473 49 By default quacktrip uses a 'conniption' server at foo.ucsd.edu
\, port 3840 (hexadecimal "f00") to connect calls. You can enter an
alternative server name or IP address in the "server" control. Or you
can set that up automatically as in teh message box at bottom left.
;
#X text 20 510 Note: the quacktrip-panel and other objects used here
are in the "lib" subdirectory of this directory - this is specified
by the "declare" object in this window. If you rearrange the directory
structure you'll have to change the declare object to reflect that.
;
#X text 467 132 The conniption server itself is just another Pd patch
\, included in the "lib" directory here. If you want to make calls
between computers behind the same router \, you will need also to run
a copy of that patch behind the same router. It can reside on one of
the computers you're connecting. Calls between two patches on the same
computer won't work (but see below about client/server mode).;
#X text 521 244 LATENCY TESTING:;
#X text 524 478 CLIENT/SERVER MODE AND OTHER SETUPS:;
#X text 19 153 IEM offers a much more complete open-source solution
called vrr that can handle several performers and is OK for actual
performances and recordings: https://vrr.iem.sh/ . Vrr uses a hub-and-spoke
design in which a centrally placed computer mixes all the audio and
can re-broadcast it. (The advantage to using quacktrip is that it's
simpler to use and doesn't require a centrally placed sound engineer.)
Like quacktrip \, vrr is open source free software.;
#X text 290 665 <--- this is for testing behind a common NAT router
using a local conniption server. It won't work unless you have one
set up., f 45;
#X text 468 259 You can measure round-trip latency by opening the quacktrip
panels at both ends of a call. (First \, set the input gains to zero.)
You open them by right-clicking the panels. Inside _that_ there's a
sub-patch called "latency". At one end \, select "loop-back" \, and
on the other \, "measure latency". At bottom in the window you should
see the measured latency in msec. If the audio breaks up a button will
flash and the readout will be wrong. Between two machines on the same
network I was able to get 16 msec latency \, using block size 64 and
FIFO size 7 Increasing block size to 128 might make the network run
more smoothly but I've never noticed a difference. In this case the
minimum latency seems to be 18 msec. I haven't done any latency testing
across real networks yet.;
#X text 474 497 The "quacktrip" object can be configured as a jacktrip-
compatible server or client - this might be useful if you want to use
quacktrip with jacktrip \, or to build a hub-and-spoke solution like
vrr. See the quacktrip help window for a very rough example. In this
usage you don't need a conniption server at all. OR... you can use
the conniption server without quacktrip to make other kinds of peer-to-peer
connections \, such as sending Pd messages from one machine to another.
